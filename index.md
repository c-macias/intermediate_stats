SYLLABUS HERE

##Software

All instruction will be done using the free and open source R statistical programming language, and the RStudio integrated development environment. You can download R [https://cran.r-project.org/]here and RStudio [https://www.rstudio.com/]here. If you prefer (I think it's a great option), you can sign up for an [https://rstudio.cloud/]RStudio Cloud account to write and execute your programs on a cloud server through your web browser. 

I also strongly encourage you to learn and publish your assignments using markdown SUMMARISE MARKDOWN HERE
