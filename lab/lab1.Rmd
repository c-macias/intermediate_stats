## Installing packages in R from CRAN

```{r eval = F}
install.packages("tidyverse")
install.packages("devtools")
```

## Installing the rethinking package

```{r eval = F}
devtools::install_github("rmcelreath/rethinking",
                         ref="Experimental")
```

## Loading installed packages

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(rethinking)
```

## Objects in R

Atomic objects store a single thing

```{r}
my_number<-2
my_letter<-"p"
my_pizza<-"margherita please"
```
## We can manipulate objects with math!

```{r}
my_number * 2
my_number^2
sqrt(my_number)
```

## But some things don't make sense

```{r eval = F}
my_number + my_pizza
```

## R Projects keep you organized!

Your root directory becomes fixed in an R Project to the folder where you are working.

Once you are in a project, all files and folders are relative to your root directory - this is good!

## We can load data in from external files

```{r}
my_data <- read.csv("cars.csv")
### for you to run
# my_data<-read.csv("./lab/cars.csv")
```
## Learn about your data frame, str()

```{r}
str(my_data)
```

## Learn about your data frame, head()

```{r}
head(my_data)
```

## Learn about your data frame, summary()

```{r}
summary(my_data)
```

## Data frames collect vectors

```{r}
my_data$speed
```

## Vectors are indexed

```{r}
my_data$speed[2]
```

## Vectors can be summarized

```{r}
table(cars$speed)
```


## We can do math with vectors (matrix operations)

```{r}
my_data$speed + my_data$dist
```

## We can summarize vectors

```{r}
sum(cars$speed)
mean(cars$speed)
median(cars$speed)
```

## Define new columns in a data frame

```{r}
my_data$cool_variable<-my_data$speed + my_data$dist
```

## Practice

1. Load in the mtcars data using data(mtcars)\
2. What is the average miles per gallon in this data?
3. Calculate the ratio of miles per gallon to weight for each car
3. What is the average ratio of miles per gallon to weight?
4. How many cars have 6 cylinders? 
5. Create a new variable equal to the sum of mpg and cyl
6. Calculate the square root of each car's mpg
7. Calculate the average square root of each car's mpg
