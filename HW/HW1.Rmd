## Question 1

For this problem, we will use data built into R. Load the data using the console command \texttt{data(anscombe)}. 

Describe the relationships between y1 and x1, y2 and x2, y3 and x3, and y4 and x4 in sequence. Construct linear regression models and any descriptive statistics or visuals that you find helpful. Compare results across the y~x pairs. Do you notice anything interesting across your results? If so, describe the implications of your findings.

## Question 2

Repeat the analysis from Question 1, but this time, use a loop in your code to run a regression model on each y~x pair. Hint: you can either use column position or create two vectors of column names as your loop index for regression variables. 

## Question 3

Use the data in revenue_dat.csv in the course repository. 

1. Load in the data
2. Use the mutate() function in the dplyr package to construct a new measure for property tax revenue per capita called prop_tax_pc using the variables rev_prop_tax and tot_pop.
3. Transform prop_tax_pc into a binary variable equal to TRUE if property tax revenues per capita are greater than or equal to the median value of the variable, FALSE otherwise
4. Run a linear regression model of the proportion of the population in deep poverty (pop_pct_deep_pov) as a function of property tax revenues per capita (your binary measure).
5. Add an interaction term. Interact your property tax indicator with the racial composition of the county (pct_blk = pop_blk / pop_tot)
6. Display your results

## Question 4

Describe and interpret the results from the interaction model. Explain the meaning of the coefficients. Use graphs to help explain the findings.
